Owners have no real reason to spend money as each hotel is individually owned so they wont benefit from the increase in brand reputation, this results in many run down hotel rooms and facilities. 

Accor prides itself on running hotels cheaper, often at the expense of guest and staff experience, prepare to spend your life apologizing for the owners decision to not upgrade the 15 year old rooms etc. 

Many times  I've seen a promotion offered internally, only for the staff to be told that we no longer require it as a ""manager position"" etc so it will be the same job just no salary increase. Leaving the staff member with an increased work load but no salary increase or even title recognition, lost a few good staff this way."

This varies by department - according to the org chart, one department has 4 directors and 3 employees (Business Dev) while other departments don't seem to have any executives (mainly the various support departments who are left to fend for themselves at the table)

The 'executive' class seems to get all kinds of lovely bonuses (personal trips, huge bonuses etc), while everyone else has to cut costs constantly.

But the work was alot more than i expected for that pay. You're not just front desk. Youre also a housekeeper, room checker, if a tv is broken you have to see if you can fix it, you take things to rooms for needy guests, you negotiate constantly, us night auditors have to cook breakfast and clean the halls and lobby...Im not one to complain about hard work but when other hotels pay $10-11 an hour to do the same stuff the motivation is lowered significantly.
No bennefits -  and dont even get hurt on the job. A minor papercut or worse burn from cooking breakfast management tries to skimp anywhere they can just so you dont have to file for workers comp. I got burned from the coffee machines hot water tap, the standing GM did not want to hear about it. Luckly it healed in a good three hours.
The management is very nice but wont work with you at all. I started part time as a night auditor, then i asked if i could  start full time on the morning and afternoon shifts. Although i was promised nothing i kept asking and proving myself only to be told ""Oh we will get you on the day shift as soon as we can..."" Its been two months and im still full time night. My body cant do it and my weight is dropping because i cant keep a normal eating scheduel. Also its apparently difficult for them to make a scheduel because sometimes id be called in to work after planning my days off only to be told they made a mistake and ment to put me on.

The work I used to do there wasn't too bad either, even tho the company was quite unorganised, which meant late working hours. it wasn't necessarily a problem for me, I was handling it fine. My main problem was with the management, they had no sense of structure or understanding. I was working here as a graphic designer, for two and half months. They had only two graphic designers including me creating design's for more than 8 departments. It was slightly difficult at start as I had a terrible hand over with 2 day quick introductory training but managed to adjust fine within a week or so. I was creating artworks for 2017 for the buyers who were going through several stages of range reviews. After seeing that nearly 80% of my work was selected in these range reviews I was extremely excited to feel I was having positive impact on the company. Was constantly reaching out to the buyers asking for feedback and whether or not if they felt supported by the work I was creating, had every strong feedback from ""HARDGOODS"" department as they felt ""this was the strongest year they had for designs"". ""MENSWEAR"" stated that they were ""one stage ahead from last year in terms of designs"". So everything was going great until just a week before my probation period was coming to an end. I was handed a letter while in middle of work, for probation review. With comments stating ""Poor Communication"", ""Missing deadlines"", ""Bad Management"" and was called to a meeting. I was just shocked and just devastated, as I felt these were very unfair statements. I collected as much evidence I could to try and defend myself from these comments, printed out my selected designs, deadline spreadsheets then went to the meeting. Sat down as my manager made claims of me missing deadlines, poor communication and poor management therefore we will have to let you go. She kept the comments very vague as possible and as she finished speaking. I asked if she would kindly expand on where exactly I missed the deadline to which she said oh I just heard alot of buyers saying that. I asked for specific's but she changed the subject to ""Poor Communication"". She stated that she overheard me asking more than few question to the buyers and wasting their time not understanding what they needed, which I found was outrageous comment to make. But I responded by admitting yea out of all the things you have claimed, you are probably right to a extent about the fact I may have asked more than one questions sometimes. But it was in the beginning as I was still trying to adjust and it was genuine questions for area's I didn't understand fully. Since when is it wrong to ask questions? But then again I can show you evidence right in front of me that more than 80% of designs that I've created has been selected by ""yourself"" along with other managers in the range review and has had positive feedbacks. Surely that at-least proves that I was understanding what you wanted and delivering?, she completely ignored my request for an opportunity to try and prove myself and just took the conversation around in circle still keeping it extremely vague. So I knew that I would not get anywhere with this and looked over to the guy from ""HR"" who was next to her and asked if I will get an opportunity for an appeal. As I found this very unfair, and all due respect to her i feel i've been falsely accused and even if we say for the arguments sake that all these points were true. Why wasn't I confronted about this earlier? surely everyone deserve's at least one opportunity to know where they were falling behind on and to see if they can act improve on those points. this is the second meeting i've had, the first one was completely positive. The manager made snarky comment from the side saying we are a fast moving company and I am usually really busy so don't really get the time to confront all employees, its you who should have arranged a meeting with me and asked. Just another outrageous comment from her, I honestly wanted to say ""are you sure it's me that needs to work on my management skills?"" but yea tried not to go down to her level. Spoke to the HR guy later, he stated he will send me an appeal letter within a week for an opportunity to make my case. Well now its 2 and half weeks, nothing whatsoever. I emailed them kindly requesting an update which was completely ignored. Again to be frankly honest I wouldn't have worked there even if there was a positive outcome from my appeal as I wouldn't mentally feel comfortable going back to that environment, I just wanted to state my case and at lest defined myself from this accusation. Anyway sorry for my long rant, hopefully my experience will be some help to some of you."

Ridiculous amount of pointless meetings
Too many methods of internal communication resulting in data overload and missed comms.
Since the coronavirus staff have been informed that they will not receive any bonuses or pay increases, which is completely understandably and I agree with. However, Sage Australia have also decided to use the pandemic remove the annual leave liability to company. Staff receive 4 weeks annual leave. 1 week must be taken at Christmas. In face of the CoVid-19 staff are being 'forced' to use at least 2 weeks of their Annual leave during the winter months. This has been done inconspicuously with no official communication from the senior management team. 
Sage needs to start their employees as assets and not liabilities."
