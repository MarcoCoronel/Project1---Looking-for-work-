Good independence working encouraged to self operate.","Every hotel its its own kingdom run differently with different cultures. 

Owners have no real reason to spend money as each hotel is individually owned so they wont benefit from the increase in brand reputation, this results in many run down hotel rooms and facilities. 

Accor prides itself on running hotels cheaper, often at the expense of guest and staff experience, prepare to spend your life apologizing for the owners decision to not upgrade the 15 year old rooms etc. 

Many times  I've seen a promotion offered internally, only for the staff to be told that we no longer require it as a ""manager position"" etc so it will be the same job just no salary increase. Leaving the staff member with an increased work load but no salary increase or even title recognition, lost a few good staff this way."

Resource management is so convoluted that in practice the only way to get on to projects is to know the right people, which results in a bit of a ""boys club"" atmosphere on some accounts.

And obviously lots and lots of systems that you have to go through for everything from reclaiming expenses to trying to be promoted, none of which seem to integrate at all."

I was lucky to have hard working  and diverse colleagues as well as pretty fair managers. On the whole they're pretty flexible with hours and scheduling. If someone wants to move up in the business- as my store manager did from the age of 15- there is a clear hierarchy and good workers including myself were rewarded for their dedication and ability. I felt like the senior management respect the value of each individual worker.","Although legal according to Australian labour laws, having to pay for meals at work seems pretty cheap from a company that pays minimum wage. As I was under 16 -the lowest paid- the managers were a little too keen to get me to work every holiday and you have to replace your shift with the same pay bracket. I often felt pressure from the managers when I tried to refuse to replace a shift. Work can be dull and repetitive, but if you're working with good people the time can fly by."

Since the coronavirus staff have been informed that they will not receive any bonuses or pay increases, which is completely understandably and I agree with. However, Sage Australia have also decided to use the pandemic remove the annual leave liability to company. Staff receive 4 weeks annual leave. 1 week must be taken at Christmas. In face of the CoVid-19 staff are being 'forced' to use at least 2 weeks of their Annual leave during the winter months.
